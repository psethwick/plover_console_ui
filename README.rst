###############
Getting Started
###############

1. Open Plover
#. Navigate to the Plugin Manager tool
#. Select ``plover_console_ui`` in the list
#. Click install

Or directly install ``plover_console_ui`` into Plover's python environment using ``plover -s plover_plugins install plover_console_ui``

- Note: The plover command is available under slightly different names depending on your OS, relative to your installation directory.
  - **Windows**: ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Steno Project\Plover 4.0.0\plover_console.exe``
  - **macOS**: ``/Applications/Plover.app/Contents/MacOS/Plover``
  - **Linux**: ``plover.AppImage``

For more information on Plover's Command Line Reference, see `The Plover Docs <https://plover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_reference.html>`_.

Linux/Mac
=========

Start Plover with the -g option:
``plover -g console``

If your shell returns ``command not found: plover`` or a similar error, refer to Getting Started to access the ``plover`` command.

Windows
=======

Due to some Windows workaround code (in Plover), this plugin does not work well on the packaged Windows build

Here's a launcher that works:
``python -m plover -g console``

Yes, it requires essentially 'run from source'... I'm sorry

If your shell returns ``command not found: plover`` or a similar error, refer to Getting Started to access the ``plover`` command.

#####
Usage
#####

Regular Use
===========

Plover commands are all functional:

- ``{PLOVER:LOOKUP}``
- ``{PLOVER:ADD_TRANSLATION}``
- ``{PLOVER:SUSPEND}``
- ``{PLOVER:RESUME}``
- ``{PLOVER:TOGGLE}``
- ``{PLOVER:FOCUS}``
- ``{PLOVER:CONFIGURE}``

Note for the commands which do window manager focus:

- ``LOOKUP``
- ``ADD_TRANSLATION``
- ``FOCUS``
- ``CONFIGURE``

This ``console_ui`` only knows which window it lives in *if* that window has focus on start-up

Otherwise: expect the focus feature not to work

Key Commands
============

These key commands are always available when ``console_ui`` has focus:

- ``Ctrl-C`` or ``Ctrl-Q``: Exits Plover
- ``PageUp/PageDown``: Scrolls the ``console`` buffer up/down

  (Note: if anything new is added to ``console`` it will auto-scroll back down)

Command Line
============

The ``help`` command is *always* available and will show all the currently
available commands

If a command has the description ``...`` there are further commands
contained inside

Commands can be partially entered

    ``m`` to use the ``machine`` command

Once you know your way around, you don't need to enter each menu one at a time

    ``col for goldenrod`` from the top level

Case is ignored 

    ``configure`` is the same as ``CONFIGURE``

To get back to the previous menu level, press ``Enter`` on its own

If a command has ``<>`` in its description it takes one or more arguments. The type
of the argument is between the ``<>``
